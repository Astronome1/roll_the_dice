Roll the Dice
Las Vegas style dice have 6 sides numbered 1 to 6. When rolling 2 dice, 
a six is 5 times more likely then a two because a six can be rolled 5 
different ways (1 + 5, 5 + 1, 2 + 4, 4 + 2, 3 + 3), while a two can only
be rolled. 1 way (1 + 1).

Create a function that accepts two arguments, the number of dice rolled, 
and the outcome of the roll. The function returns the number of possible 
combinations that could produce that outcome. The number of dice can vary 
from 1 to 6.

For the example given above:

diceRoll(2, 6) would return 5
diceRoll(2, 2) would return 1
